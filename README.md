<h2>Hi,</h2>

    <p>In this basic project of creating and moving shapes using SFML, I used simple file operations to read a configuration file that defines the shapes' behavior and properties.</p>

    <p>I attempted to use the concept of polymorphism and shared pointers to create a vector of shared pointers for storing shapes, and another vector of type sf::Vector2f to store speeds (i.e., movements in the x and y directions).</p>
